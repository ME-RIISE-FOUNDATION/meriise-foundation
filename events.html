                        With the introduction to ME-RIISE, the event began with
                        explaining what is an entrepreneur's day. Then, the
                        introduction of resource person Johnson Tellis who is
                        the CEO of TCE (Technical Career Education), Co-founder
                        and CEO at Inunity, Director of Dtlabz R&D Private

                        professor and head, Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering. Then, Sir took over the session and asked
                        the participants to identify the logo and what they
                        stand for. He explained exactly what entrepreneurship is
                        all about. He also explained the IKIGAI- a Japanese
                        concept that means the reason for your being.

                        Students were instructed <br />

                        • To find a mission statement from the IKIGAI. <br />

                        • To educate themselves.<br />

                        • To engage with the community, as one can't do things
                        on his own without inspiration from others.<br />

                        • Re-align ourselves with discipline and routine.<br />

                        • Be with people who are energetic and motivated.<br />

                        • Build lots of prototypes and go check with people
                        whether it is useful to them or not.<br />

                        • Come and redesign and again validate, iterate this and
                        expand your base.<br />

                        • Finally, innovate.<br />

                        • He also suggested some books such as The Richest Man
                        in Babylon, Psychology Of Money, Atomic Habits, and The
                        Alchemist.<br />

                        The event was very well organized with a lot of
                        information to learn and take forward in our daily

                        The word Hackathon is portmanteau from the words "hack"
                        and "marathon". The main intension of it is to inculcate
                        problem-solving knacks among Engineering aspirants. An
                        engineer can’t run away from problems, he will have to
                        come up with conceptions which is one his duty.

                        Amid this pandemic, MERIISE in collaboration with NAIN
                        had organized a one-day online hackathon called

                        budding engineers across the state. More than 20 teams
                        from various engineering colleges participated. This
                        hackathon was based on the concept of battling COVID-19
                        using technology by understanding the need of the day.
                        To battle this pandemic the participants had to come up
                        with innovative ideas. COVID-19 is a challenge to the
                        whole of mankind, to suppress the spread is not facile.
                        Technology has vast applications irrespective of fields.
                        Utilizing technology to win the battle of COVID-19 was
                        the motive of the event. The event provided a platform
                        to the students to exhibit their analytical skills. The
                        participants came up with solutions where the objective

                        dealt with by traditional data-processing application

                        complexity(more attributes or columns)may lead to higher
